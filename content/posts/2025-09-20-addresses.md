While there are many uncertainties and forgotten promises around UK addresses being released as Open Data, little has materialised. <abbr title="OpenStreetMap United Kingdom">OSM UK</abbr> is happy to announce we're making our data easily available for people to use.
This dataset is a small subset of our data, please [explore further](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features).

We look forward to the day where our government will do the right thing and release the official data.
