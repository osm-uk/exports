Owen Boswarva has been doing amazing work opening up councils address data.
He [recently obtained data](https://www.owenboswarva.com/blog/post-addr16.htm) from Sheffield City Council.
This dataset was released without <abbr title="Unique Property Reference Numbers">UPRNs</abbr>, so it cannot be geocoded with Ordnance Survey data.

Instead <abbr title="OpenStreetMap United Kingdom">OSM UK</abbr> has geocoded it with OpenStreetMap data.
It is made available under the <abbr title="Open Data Database License">ODbL</abbr>, you are free to use it but you must credit OpenStreetMap and its contributors.
More information is available at [osm.org/copyright](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).

It includes the use of [Code-Point® Open](https://osdatahub.os.uk/data/downloads/open/CodePointOpen) provided under the [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).
